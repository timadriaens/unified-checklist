Here we choose the checklists we want to include and rank them by trust (most trustworthy first). The ranking will help to choose between duplicate taxa in later steps. Choose checklists: checklist_keys &lt;- c( &quot;9ff7d317-609b-4c08-bd86-3bc404b77c42&quot;, # alien-plants-belgium &quot;289244ee-e1c1-49aa-b2d7-d379391ce265&quot;, # alien-macroinvertebrates &quot;98940a79-2bf1-46e6-afd6-ba2e85a26f9f&quot;, # alien-fishes-checklist &quot;b043c480-dd36-4f4f-aa82-e188753ff09d&quot;, # uredinales-belgium-checklist &quot;1f3505cd-5d98-4e23-bd3b-ffe59d05d7c2&quot;, # ad-hoc-checklist &quot;1738f272-6b5d-4f43-9a92-453a8c5ea50a&quot;, # rinse-pathways-checklist &quot;3f5e930b-52a5-461d-87ec-26ecd66f14a3&quot; # rinse-registry-checklist ) Get metadata for these checklists from GBIF and display the result: Save to CSV. 2.2 Get taxa Get taxa from these checklists from GBIF. Note: here we get checklist taxa, not GBIF backbone taxa. Select columns of interest, rename key to taxonKey and sort by taxonKey. Convert the column issues from a list to a concatenated string. Preview checklist taxa: 2.3 Filter on distribution TrIAS checklists can contain more than alien species in Belgium. We therefore need to filter on the associated distribution information (using the trias::has_distribution() function) as follows: In Belgium: country(code) = BE Present: occurrenceStatus status = PRESENT, COMMMON, RARE OR IRREGULAR Introduced: establishmentMeans = INTRODUCED, NATURALISED, INVASIVE OR ASSISTED COLONISATION Note: we filter on distribution information of checklist taxa, not GBIF backbone taxa. That is because backbone taxa contain distribution information from TrIAS checklists and other checklists, which we don’t want to consider here. E.g. compare: Distributions for checklist taxon Eriocheir sinensis (140563012) Distributions for backbone taxon Eriocheir sinensis (2225776) Note: if a checklist has related information for a taxon, but not a valid distribution, that related information will NOT be included in the unified checklist. This is to exclude related information about a taxon for which the checklist did not even consider a Belgian scope (e.g. pathway). Get distribution information from GBIF and check if these meet the filter criteria. The result (TRUE/FALSE) is inserted as an extra column validDistribution. Preview some taxa with not a single valid distribution (taxonKey can be used to verify manually on GBIF): Rename nubKey to bb_key and move to the end. 2.4 Get GBIF backbone taxonomy information A taxon can occur on more than one checklist. To identify these duplicates, we cannot rely on the scientific name as there might be spelling variations (e.g. with or without authorship) and it does not account for synonyms that should be lumped with the accepted taxon. To have unifying taxon identifiers across taxa, we rely on the GBIF backbone taxonomy, to which every checklist taxon (re)published to GBIF is automatically matched. If a match in the backbone is found, the checklist taxon will have a nubKey. Filter taxa on having valid distribution and nubKey and create vector of unique nubKeys. Get GBIF backbone taxonomy information. Rename accepted to acceptedName. Add prefix bb_ to column names. Select columns of interest. Remove duplicates (caused by this bug). Merge backbone information with checklist taxa. Note: this can attach information to taxa with validDistribution = FALSE that share a bb_key with other taxa. Preview merged information: 2.5 Show summary and save Show summary per checklist: Save to two CSVs: data/raw/taxa.csv: all checklist taxa data/interim/taxa_with_verification.csv: subset of checklist taxa with a valid distribution and an empty column verificationKey.

["verify_taxa.html", "4 Verify taxa 4.1 Read taxa 4.2 Read verification information 4.3 Run and save verification 4.4 Show verification status", " 4 Verify taxa In this chapter we verify taxonomic information returned by the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy. We do this because we want to use the backbone information to unify taxa that can be considered the same within or across checklists. This is straightforward for (accepted) taxa with the same backbone key (bb_key), but requires verification for taxa the backbone does not recognize (no backbone match) or will lump under another name (synonyms). See 4.2. 4.1 Read taxa Read taxa from data/interim/taxa_with_verification.csv. 4.2 Read verification information Verification information consists of a manually assigned verificationKey for taxa the backbone does not recognize (no backbone match) or will lump under another name (synonyms). Those checklist/backbone/accepted taxon combinations are stored in data/interim/verification.tsv, which was created/updated in previous runs of this chapter and then manually annoted with a verificationKey. 4.3 Run and save verification Use the existing verification information to verify taxa with the function trias::verify_taxa: verification &lt;- trias::verify_taxa(taxa, verification) Note: to start a verification from scratch, use trias::verify_taxa(taxa). Save taxa with populated verificationKey back to data/interim/taxa_with_verification.csv. Save updated verification back to data/interim/verification.tsv (sorted on scientificName) 4.4 Show verification status 4.4.1 Unmatched taxa Status Number of taxa Verified 0 Unverified 114 New in this run 0 No longer used (TODO: for unmatched only) Unmatched taxa are those for which the automatic backbone matching on the scientific name failed (have BACKBONE_MATCH_NONE in issues), either because the scientific name could not be parsed or because it is not listed in the backbone. Verification (see 4.2) involves setting the verificationKey to a manually found bb_key. One could even set multiple bb_keys, e.g. to split a hybrid formula into its hybrid parents. 4.4.2 Synonyms Status Number of taxa Previously verified 0 Unverified 985 New in this run 0 No longer used (TODO: for synonyms only) Synonyms are taxa that the backbone will lump under an accepted taxon (taxonomicStatus = SYNONYM or similar). This lumping is often correct, but should be verified. Verification (see 4.2) involves setting the verifiedKey to one of the following: accepted bb_key suggested by GBIF: backbone synonymy is accepted and taxon will be lumped. another accepted bb_key: backbone synonymy is rejected, but taxon will be lumped under another name. bb_key of taxon itself: backbone synonymy is rejected, taxon will be considered as separate taxon. 4.4.3 Accepted taxa Status Number of taxa Verified (automatic) 5008 Unverified 0 Accepted taxa are those the backbone considers own entities (taxonomicStatus = ACCEPTED or DOUBTFUL) that won’t be lumped. No verification is required for these: verificationKey is automatically set to their bb_key. 4.4.4 Erroneous verificationKeys Provided verification keys that were not found in the GBIF backbone: ## NULL 4.4.5 Additional information Additional information regarding the verification information that is of no further consequence. Duplicate taxa (having same bb_key and bb_acceptedKey) that are quick wins to verify: Previously listed synonyms for which the scientific name was updated in the backbone: ## NULL Previously listed synonyms for which the accepted scientific name was updated in the backbone: ## NULL "],
