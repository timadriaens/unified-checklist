Here we choose the checklists we want to include and rank them by trust (most trustworthy first). The ranking will help to choose between duplicate taxa in later steps. Choose checklists. checklist_keys &lt;- c( &quot;9ff7d317-609b-4c08-bd86-3bc404b77c42&quot;, # alien-plants-belgium &quot;289244ee-e1c1-49aa-b2d7-d379391ce265&quot;, # alien-macroinvertebrates &quot;98940a79-2bf1-46e6-afd6-ba2e85a26f9f&quot;, # alien-fishes-checklist &quot;b043c480-dd36-4f4f-aa82-e188753ff09d&quot;, # uredinales-belgium-checklist &quot;1f3505cd-5d98-4e23-bd3b-ffe59d05d7c2&quot;, # ad-hoc-checklist &quot;1738f272-6b5d-4f43-9a92-453a8c5ea50a&quot;, # rinse-pathways-checklist &quot;3f5e930b-52a5-461d-87ec-26ecd66f14a3&quot; # rinse-registry-checklist ) Get metadata for these checklists from GBIF and display the result. Save to CSV. 2.2 Get taxa Get taxa from these checklists from GBIF. Note: here we get checklist taxa, not GBIF backbone taxa. Select columns of interest, rename key to taxonKey and sort by taxonKey. Convert the column issues from a list to a concatenated string. Preview checklist taxa. 2.3 Filter on distribution TrIAS checklists can contain more than alien species in Belgium. We therefore need to filter on the associated distribution information (using the trias::has_distribution() function) as follows: In Belgium: country(code) = BE Present: occurrenceStatus status = PRESENT, COMMMON, RARE OR IRREGULAR Introduced: establishmentMeans = INTRODUCED, NATURALISED, INVASIVE OR ASSISTED COLONISATION Note: we filter on distribution information of checklist taxa, not GBIF backbone taxa. That is because backbone taxa contain distribution information from TrIAS checklists and other checklists, which we don’t want to consider here. E.g. compare: Distributions for checklist taxon Eriocheir sinensis (140563012) Distributions for backbone taxon Eriocheir sinensis (2225776) Get distribution information from GBIF and check if these meet the filter criteria. The result (TRUE/FALSE) is inserted as an extra column validDistribution. Preview some taxa with not a single valid distribution (taxonKey can be used to verify manually on GBIF). Rename nubKey to bb_key and move to the end. 2.4 Get GBIF backbone taxonomy information A taxon can occur on more than one checklist. To identify these duplicates, we cannot rely on the scientific name as there might be spelling variations (e.g. with or without authorship) and it does not account for synonyms that should be lumped with the accepted taxon. To have unifying taxon identifiers across taxa, we rely on the GBIF backbone taxonomy, to which every checklist taxon (re)published to GBIF is automatically matched. If a match in the backbone is found, the checklist taxon will have a nubKey. Filter taxa on having valid distribution and nubKey and create vector of unique nubKeys. Get GBIF backbone taxonomy information. Select columns of interest. Remove duplicates (caused by this bug). Rename accepted to acceptedName. Add prefix bb_ to column names. Merge backbone information with checklist taxa. Preview merged information. 2.5 Show summary and save Show summary per checklist. Save to CSV. "],

Note: if a checklist has related information for a taxon, but not a valid distribution, that related information will NOT be included in the unified checklist. This is to exclude related information about a taxon for which the checklist did not even consider a Belgian scope (e.g. pathway). 3.3 Get distributions Get distributions for our taxa from GBIF.
